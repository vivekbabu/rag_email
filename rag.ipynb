The states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to revise the price mitigation plan to deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. There is confusion and uncertainty among suppliers about the new price restrictions, causing some to withhold power from California. Enron is seeking comments on the draft before filing it.\n",

When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. \\\\n\\\\nEntergy Back End:\\\\n  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)\\\\n\\\\nNY Curves:\\\\n  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOn Peak\\\\n1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.\\\\n2.

The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20\\nThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20\\nFERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr=\\nice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p=\\nlant operating in California during a \"power alert\" declared by the Indepen=\\ndent System Operator, which runs the state\\'s power-transmission grid. When =\\nthere\\'s no alert, prices can\\'t exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ=\\nished during the latest alert.=20\\nUntil Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=\\nn California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte=\\nrnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent=\\n of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20\\nBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif=\\nornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h=\\now much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20\\nThe ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=\\n98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =\\npremium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there\\'s a cred=\\nit risk in selling to the state.=20\\nO\\'Donnell said it\\'s likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=\\nime the ISO declares a power alert.=20\\nIn-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO.

It was the first such emergency since =\\nMay 31.\\n     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=\\nnded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=\\nmergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=\\nes to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20\\n     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=\\ne most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=\\n grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.\\n     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =\\nis supposed to be established under the commission\\'s order, and that appare=\\nntly drove away sellers, Hart said.\\n     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=\\n the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=\\nad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=\\n backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=\\n Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit=\\n of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.\\n     Forced to dip even deeper into the state\\'s power reserves and declare =\\na Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=\\nssion\\'s hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=\\nen it should take effect. They got no answer.\\n     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=\\nify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=\\nuppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.\\n     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=\\nt is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=\\nce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=\\ntely.\\n     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =\\nhad anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in =\\npart because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr=\\need to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea=\\nch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this =\\nsummer.\\n     \"Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through,\" Hart said=\\n.=20\\n\\nCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJames D Steffes\\n07/06/2001 10:04 PM\\nTo:=09Jeffrey T Hodge/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert C Williams/Enron@EnronXGate\\ncc:=09Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda R=\\nobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Alan Comnes/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enr=\\non@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Ray Alvarez/N=\\nA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com=20\\n\\nSubject:=09ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGDE - Draft FERC Brief on Settlement Proc=\\ness\\n\\nThe attached is a rough draft of a potential filing Enron would make in to =\\nJudge Wagner in the Settlement process (it is unclear if this would remain =\\nconfidential per the gag order).\\n\\nPlease provide Ray Alvarez your comments.

Spokesmen deny any market manipulation. \\n\\nBy ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers\\n\\n????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water \\nand Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels \\nthat helped ignite California\\'s exploding energy crisis during the summer and \\nfall, according to public and confidential records. \\n?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have \\nchiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into \\ndarkness and economic chaos. \\n?????But they are just part of the equation. \\n?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that \\nhave allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does \\nidentify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for \\nthe first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized \\nprofits in the volatile spot market. \\n?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a \\nrecent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently \\ntrying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville \\nPower Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada\\'s \\nBC Hydro in British Columbia. \\n?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers \\noffered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when \\nthe state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California\\'s three \\nlargest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas \\n& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. \\n?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, \\nanalyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in \\nthe spot, or \"real-time,\" market from May to November. The study accounted \\nfor factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of \\nscarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. \\n?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. \\n?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits \\nas British Columbia\\'s Powerex, the state records show. \\n?????\"They were the most aggressive bidders,\" said Anjali Sheffrin, author of \\nthe coded study. \\n?????\"They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,\" \\nsaid Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. \\n?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive \\nprofits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private \\ngenerators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy \\nMarketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged \\ninflated earnings. \\n?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they \\nplayed by the rules established under California\\'s flawed deregulation plan \\nand did not exploit the state\\'s troubles. \\n?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of \\nsevere power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise \\novernight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be \\nproduced inexpensively but sold for a premium. \\n?????\"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity \\nwould be at any given time,\" said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. \"We \\nhelped keep the lights on in California.\" \\n?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC \\nHydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a \"rainy day\" account to \\nensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. \\n?????Los Angeles\\' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list \\nof alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices \\nduring periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire \\nspot market, where emergency purchases are made. \\n?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power \\nat incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest \\nincreases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them \\nfrom falling. \\n?????The DWP\\'s average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity \\nultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston \\nand Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy \\nmarket. \\n?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that \\ncould pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, \\nreferring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. \"The data shows they \\nclearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load \\nconditions.\" \\n?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report\\'s findings \\n\"outrageous,\" insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. \\n?????\"These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes \\nunpunished in this state,\" Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert \\nmore blackouts across the state. \\n?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for \\nsurplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to \\nproduce. \\n?????\"We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%,\" he said. \\n\"It\\'s not as though we\\'re up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down \\ntheir throats.\" \\n?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never \\ntook it personally. \"If you\\'re innocent,\" he said, \"you don\\'t look at the \\ncriminal file.\" \\n?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California\\'s \\nderegulated market was the U.S. government\\'s Bonneville Power Administration, \\na nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal \\ndams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. \\n?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but \\nreaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it \\nsupplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was \\nin the top five accused of taking excessive profits. \\n?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back \\nfederal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon \\nrecovery program. \\n?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act \\nimproperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached \\nits conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading \\nfor last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. \\n?????\"From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we \\noperated precisely within the terms of their rules,\" Oliver said. \\n?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so \\ndistorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act \\nresponsibly, has bailed out. \\n?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier \\nstudied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant\\'s $138, \\nthe highest. \\n?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers \\noffering power received the highest price paid in any hour. \\n?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to \\nsell at a single-digit price. \\n?????\"They weren\\'t the culprits,\" said Cal-ISO\\'s Sheffrin. \"Someone else \\ndrove that up.\" \\n?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California \\nmarket because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he \\nsaid, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. \\n?????\"We looked at it and we didn\\'t feel very comfortable with what we saw,\" \\nhe said. \\n?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the \\nprice for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn\\'t made much difference because \\nthe overall prices are still excessive. \\n?????\"We\\'re saying the patient is sick,\" Sheffrin said of California\\'s \\nelectricity market. \"It needs help [and] may die.\" \\n????? ---------------------- Forwarded by Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT on 05/01/2001 12:46 \\nPM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nAlan Comnes\\n04/11/2001 02:02 PM\\nTo: seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, \\nasettanni@bracepatt.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tim \\nHeizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: LADWP, BC Hydro, Bonneville Accused of Gouging California\\n\\nThe identities refered to in this article apparently relate to Sheffrin\\'s \\nstudy.\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT on 04/11/2001 02:08 \\nPM ---------------------------\\nFrom: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON on 04/11/2001 11:49 AM CDT\\nSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\\nTo: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly \\nAden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol \\nMoffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT, \\nChristina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Craig H Sutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan \\nLeff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, \\nDon Black/HOU/EES@EES, Douglas Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward \\nSacks/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES, \\nEvan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Gayle W \\nMuench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, \\nHarold G Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, Iris \\nWaser/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, \\nJeff Messina/HOU/EES@EES, Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess \\nHewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen \\nDenne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathy Bass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken \\nGustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevin Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, \\nLeticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES, Mark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha \\nSuggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES, Meredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, \\nMichael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Mann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D \\nCisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, mpalmer@enron.com, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil \\nHong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard \\nL Zdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard \\nShapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rosalinda \\nTijerina/HOU/EES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah \\nNovosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, \\nSharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES, skean@enron.com, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tasha \\nLair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tim \\nBelden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES, \\nVladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S \\nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kathryn Corbally/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jubran \\nWhalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Robert C \\nWilliams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James \\nWright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Dirk vanUlden/Western \\nRegion/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Steve Walker/SFO/EES@EES, Jennifer \\nRudolph/HOU/EES@EES, wgang@enron.com, Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com>, \\nHedy Govenar <hgovenar@govadv.com> @ ENRON, jklauber@llgm.com, Mike D \\nSmith/HOU/EES@EES, Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Eric Letke/DUB/EES@EES, \\nRichard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com, Michael \\nTribolet/ENRON@enronXgate, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J \\nMara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mercy Gil/Enron@EnronXGate, Jennifer \\nThome/NA/Enron@Enron, David Leboe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda \\nRobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron, Donna \\nFulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: LADWP, BC Hydro, Bonneville Accused of Gouging California\\n\\nEnergy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too \\n Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices \\nup.

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors \\nCaramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations \\nby Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made \\nthe following points:\\nThere isn\\'t much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in \\nthe wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would \\nhurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West \\nas well.\\nHigh prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does \\nanything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised \\nby any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still \\nincenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level \\nequal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  \\nThe IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by \\nscarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, \\ntherefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time \\nprices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund \\nas an asset allocation scheme.\\nThe market would function better if more information was provided to the \\nmarket.\\nThe Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.\\nTo see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, \\nyou will find there are many \"hidden\" slides that were not part of the oral \\npresentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional \\ninformation.\\n\\nAccording to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot \\nmore out of this meeting than Staff\\'s previous meetings with the IOUs and the \\ngenerators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I\\'ve been getting, the Staff \\nis looking into the data we provided.  \\n\\nI have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to \\nScott Miller on Friday.  Tim\\'s version conveys the same message but takes a \\ndifferent approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott \\nand answered some additional questions.

The resul=\\nt,=20\\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\\n\\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\\n=20\\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\\n=20\\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\\n=20\\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\\n=20\\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\\nng=20\\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\\nn=20\\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\\ne=20\\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\\nt=20\\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\\n\\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\\ned=20\\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\\nle=20\\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\\n\\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\\nion. =20\\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\\n=20\\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\\n=20\\nspot prices.\\n\\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\\n=20\\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\\nhich,=20\\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\\n\\nEnron=01,s Role\\n\\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\\nix=20\\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\\n\\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\\n=20\\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\\n=20\\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\\ne=20\\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\\nts=20\\nfor our customers.\\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\\n=20\\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\\n=20\\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\\n\\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\\n=20\\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\\n of our=20\\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\\n\\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\\nly=20\\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\\n?

EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\\n=20\\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\\n\\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\\n=20\\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\\n=20\\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\\ners=20\\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\\n=20\\ndemand for our products and services.\\n\\nThe Solution\\n\\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.

Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\\n=20\\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\\ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=\\n=20\\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\\nfacilities.\\n\\nReducing Demand\\n\\nCustomers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\\n=20\\nThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=\\n=20\\nmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\\nd=20\\nat lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=\\n.\\n\\nReducing Reliance on the Spot Market\\n\\nIn a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\\n=20\\nterm, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=\\nds=20\\nof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\\n. =20\\nOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\\nir=20\\nprice risk.\\n\\nRestoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\\n\\nThe utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20\\ngreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\\n=20\\narrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=\\ner=20\\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\\n=20\\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\\n=20\\nneeded.\\n\\nJust as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\\n,=20\\nwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\\n=20\\nworse.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=\\n=20\\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\\n =20\\nPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\\n=20\\nand our position on California energy issues.\\n\\nWhat happened in California\\n\\nThe source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\\nly=20\\nand demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=\\neased=20\\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20\\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=\\n=20\\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=\\nt,=20\\npredictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\\npercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\\n\\nIn addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\\n=20\\nfactors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=\\n=20\\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=\\n=20\\npower is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=\\n=20\\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\\nng=20\\nterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=\\nn=20\\nCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20\\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\\ne=20\\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20\\nwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\\nt=20\\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\\n\\nSecond, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=\\ned=20\\nin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\\ncompetition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\\nle=20\\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\\nregulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.\\n\\nIn short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\\nion. =20\\nRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\\n=20\\ngeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\\n=20\\nspot prices.\\n\\nAt the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\\n=20\\nthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\\nhich,=20\\nif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\\n\\nEnron=01,s Role\\n\\nMany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\\nix=20\\nthe problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\\npoliticians and the media.  Here are the facts:\\n\\n? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\\n=20\\nstate of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\\n=20\\nsame market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20\\nmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=\\ne=20\\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\\nts=20\\nfor our customers.\\n? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\\n=20\\nthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=\\n=20\\nprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\\n\\nYou may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\\npower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\\n=20\\nthe open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=\\n of our=20\\ncustomers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:\\n\\n? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\\nmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\\nly=20\\nfrom the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\\nallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\\n? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\\nto=20\\nreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\\n? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\\n=20\\nwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\\nreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\\n\\nEnron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\\n=20\\ncrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\\n=20\\npower markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\\ners=20\\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=\\n=20\\ndemand for our products and services.\\n\\nThe Solution\\n\\nThe solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=\\n, the=20\\nstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\\net=20\\nand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\\n\\nIncreasing Supply\\n\\nCalifornia=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\\n=20\\nshort of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\\ns=20\\nthan a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=\\ny=20\\nmust streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\\n=20\\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\\ndisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.

House \\nhearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate \\nhearing was on last week\\'s FERC order on a \"soft price cap\" and related \\nissues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal \\nEnergy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation \\nImplementation Task Force.

It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. \\nmarketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis \\ndifferentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.  Whoever is \\nblamed might not really matter.  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is \\nabout to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the \\nWest.  This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing \\nside in establishing competitive markets.  Pipeline open access is of no \\navail if there is government intervention in the gas markets.  Commissioner \\nMassey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very \\nconcerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that \\nsomething needed to be done.  FERC responded with an announcement of their \\ntechnical conference on interstate pipeline capacity  and intrastate take \\naway capacity (which, by the way, doesn\\'t appear to address storage).  \\nEveryone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher \\nthan in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport \\ncosts.

The contingency reserve standard in WSCC is the greater of \\nthe largest single contingency or of a quantity equal to the sum of 5% times \\nthe load portion served by hydro plus 7% for the load portion served by \\nthermal units.  For 1000 MW served half by hydro and half by thermal, the \\ncontingency reserve would be 60 MW (500 MW *.05 + 500 MW * .07) for a total \\nof 6%.

Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) subsidiary Nevada Power experienced blackouts due to the new price controls. The price caps have resulted in a lack of speed and clarity in the market, discouraging utilities from selling excess power and hindering the effectiveness of voluntary curtailment programs. Additionally, long-term supply contracts signed before the price cap order penalize companies like SRP. The situation in Nevada highlights the unintended effects of price caps outside of California.\", 'Enron has drafted a potential filing for Judge Wagner in the Settlement process, but it is unclear if it will remain confidential. The draft discusses the unintended consequences of federal price limits on power companies, which have led to increased threats of blackouts in California and Nevada. The states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to revise the price mitigation plan to deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. There is confusion and uncertainty among suppliers about the new price restrictions, causing some to withhold power from California. Enron is seeking comments on the draft before filing it.', 'The email thread discusses the California electricity crisis and the state\\'s power purchases. The Davis administration reveals that over $5 billion has been spent on power purchases, with a significant portion going to government-owned utilities and companies accused of price gouging. The documents also show that almost 40% of the state\\'s purchases come from government-run power generators in California and the Northwest. There is debate over whether the price drop is due to long-term contracts or if the Davis administration rushed into deals committing the state to high prices. State Senator Byron Sher presents a compromise proposal to rescue financially ailing Edison, which involves power producers taking a 30% \"haircut\" and forgiving some of Edison\\'s debts, while big users would pay off the remaining debts. The level of support for this proposal in the Legislature is uncertain.', 'Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP), were found to have driven up wholesale electricity prices in California during the energy crisis. A confidential document obtained by The Times revealed that public entities, such as the DWP, Bonneville Power Administration, and BC Hydro, manipulated the market to maximize profits. These agencies offered power at high prices during times of high demand, inflating costs across the spot market. The study by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) also identified private companies, like Powerex and Mirant, for alleged excessive profits. The DWP denied trying to inflate prices, while Bonneville claimed to have followed the rules. Aquila Power Corp. withdrew from the market due to its unpredictability. The overall electricity market in California was described as sick and in need of help.', \"The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is unlikely to order power generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes. The PUC acknowledges that generators are manipulating the market but lacks the expertise to identify the culprits. Even if refunds were forced, it would take years of litigation to decide on the matter. The PUC is also undecided on whether Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric can pass on $5 billion in debt to ratepayers. Only two commissioners support refunding windfall profits. The investigation into the market manipulation has been unsuccessful in finding evidence to support refunds. Federal regulators found flaws in the market structure but did not find evidence of manipulation. The PUC does not support the utilities' efforts to pass on the wholesale power costs to ratepayers. PG&E and SoCal Edison pay 16 cents per kilowatt-hour for wholesale power but charge customers less due to a state-mandated rate freeze. SoCal Edison\", \"The California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) plans to file a petition with federal regulators to require generators to bid 70% of their supply into the forward market, aiming to reduce wholesale power costs. The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing. The move is intended to mitigate market power and protect utilities from the cost impact of market power. The ISO's action has surprised the state's Electricity Oversight Board, which is seeking clarification on whether the ISO can take this action without board approval.\", 'The email thread discusses a presentation made to the FERC Staff regarding the investigation of the wholesale market in the West, particularly in California. The presentation emphasizes that the cause of price spikes is not in the wholesale market and discourages FERC from taking actions that would harm the vibrant wholesale market. It suggests investigating market power and establishing a price cap at a scarcity rent level. The presentation also highlights the failure of IOUs to prepare for high prices caused by scarcity and suggests providing more information to the market and incenting load participation. The staff found the meeting valuable and is looking into the data provided. A revised version of the presentation is also attached, which supports eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and allowing IOUs to buy from Enron Online.', \"The email thread discusses the power crisis in California and Enron's role in it. The crisis was caused by a supply and demand imbalance, as well as regulations that prevented new generation from being built and hindered hedging against volatile spot prices. Enron clarifies that they are not biased towards high prices and have protected their customers from price volatility. They also explain their decision to source power directly from utilities in California. The solution to the crisis involves increasing supply, reducing demand, reducing reliance on the spot market, and restoring the financial stability of utilities. Price caps and state takeover of generation and transmission are not seen as effective solutions. Enron continues to propose solutions and serve their customers.\", \"The email thread discusses the House and Senate energy committee hearings on the California/Western Electric situation. The hearings were contentious, with debates on gas prices and the alleged role they play in electric power rate increases. The FERC commissioners were questioned about price mitigation and the difficulty of implementing a price cap. Chairman Hebert's statement about price mitigation in the WSCC being in place all the time was seen as a Freudian slip. Several Senators criticized the Commission for not taking action and threatened that Congress would act if necessary.\", 'Southern California Edison has filed a motion with the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) claiming that the withholding of pipeline transportation capacity has led to a rise in gas prices. The company alleges market manipulation, collusion, and abuse of market power by out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants. The CPUC has already filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is seeking a recision of certain contracts. Edison is seeking an expedited order to use a lower gas price for its payment obligations to power producers.']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'distances']}\n",

The hearings were contentious, with debates on gas prices and the alleged role they play in electric power rate increases. The FERC commissioners were questioned about price mitigation and the difficulty of implementing a price cap. Chairman Hebert's statement about price mitigation in the WSCC being in place all the time was seen as a Freudian slip. Several Senators criticized the Commission for not taking action and threatened that Congress would act if necessary.\",\n          \"Enron has drafted a potential filing for Judge Wagner in the Settlement process, but it is unclear if it will remain confidential. The draft discusses the unintended consequences of federal price limits on power companies, which have led to increased threats of blackouts in California and Nevada. The states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to revise the price mitigation plan to deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. There is confusion and uncertainty among suppliers about the new price restrictions, causing some to withhold power from California. Enron is seeking comments on the draft before filing it.\",\n          \"The California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) plans to file a petition with federal regulators to require generators to bid 70% of their supply into the forward market, aiming to reduce wholesale power costs. The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing. The move is intended to mitigate market power and protect utilities from the cost impact of market power. The ISO's action has surprised the state's Electricity Oversight Board, which is seeking clarification on whether the ISO can take this action without board approval.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Distances\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.02235806433808686,\n        \"min\": 0.2398618757724762,\n        \"max\": 0.3158174753189087,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3154807388782501,\n          0.29624488949775696,\n          0.30794912576675415\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IDs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3585\",\n          \"300\",\n          \"14\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Metadatas\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The contingency reserve standard in WSCC is the greater of \\nthe largest single contingency or of a quantity equal to the sum of 5% times \\nthe load portion served by hydro plus 7% for the load portion served by \\nthermal units.

House \\nhearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate \\nhearing was on last week's FERC order on a \\\"soft price cap\\\" and related \\nissues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal \\nEnergy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation \\nImplementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the \\nWestern Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the \\nthree FERC commissioners.\\n\\nHIghlights\\n\\nChairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton \\nbill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will \\nhappen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will \\nreport back with more information and conclusions once that is done); \\nChairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.\\nThere was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that \\nhigher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate \\nincreases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation \\ncosts for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at \\nthe Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical \\nconference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as \\nit relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country \\nattacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.\\nThe House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, \\nattacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism \\nwas that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high \\nprice since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell \\nit at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus \\nsec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their \\nstrategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA \\ntestimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region \\nto support sec. 102.\\nBoth hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a \\nprice cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among \\nthe witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could \\nbe done; the witnesses just said \\\"cost plus a reasonable profit\\\" and said \\nleave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had \\nthe staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would \\ntake too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last \\nweek's soft price cap is much better.\\nAlso on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to \\nadmit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT \\nhave taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken \\nrecently. \\nThe interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it \\nwas a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when \\nSenate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \\\"help is on the way\\\" in the form \\nof the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen.

It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. \\nmarketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \\\"fault\\\" for the large basis \\ndifferentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.  Whoever is \\nblamed might not really matter.  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is \\nabout to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the \\nWest.  This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing \\nside in establishing competitive markets.  Pipeline open access is of no \\navail if there is government intervention in the gas markets.  Commissioner \\nMassey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very \\nconcerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that \\nsomething needed to be done.  FERC responded with an announcement of their \\ntechnical conference on interstate pipeline capacity  and intrastate take \\naway capacity (which, by the way, doesn't appear to address storage).  \\nEveryone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher \\nthan in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport \\ncosts.

House \\nhearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate \\nhearing was on last week's FERC order on a \\\"soft price cap\\\" and related \\nissues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal \\nEnergy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation \\nImplementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the \\nWestern Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the \\nthree FERC commissioners.\\n\\nHIghlights\\n\\nChairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton \\nbill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will \\nhappen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will \\nreport back with more information and conclusions once that is done); \\nChairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.\\nThere was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that \\nhigher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate \\nincreases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation \\ncosts for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at \\nthe Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical \\nconference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as \\nit relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country \\nattacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.\\nThe House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, \\nattacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism \\nwas that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high \\nprice since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell \\nit at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus \\nsec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their \\nstrategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA \\ntestimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region \\nto support sec. 102.\\nBoth hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a \\nprice cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among \\nthe witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could \\nbe done; the witnesses just said \\\"cost plus a reasonable profit\\\" and said \\nleave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had \\nthe staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would \\ntake too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last \\nweek's soft price cap is much better.\\nAlso on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to \\nadmit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT \\nhave taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken \\nrecently. \\nThe interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it \\nwas a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when \\nSenate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \\\"help is on the way\\\" in the form \\nof the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that \\nsuggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern \\ncame from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat \\ncontentious at times.\\n\\nPlease advise if you have any questions or would like further details.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"My suggestions are attached.\\nTake the gloves off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJames D Steffes\\n07/06/2001 10:04 PM\\nTo: Jeffrey T Hodge/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert C Williams/Enron@EnronXGate\\ncc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda \\nRobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Alan Comnes/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeff \\nDasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, \\nRay Alvarez/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, \\ndwatkiss@bracepatt.com \\n\\nSubject: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGDE - Draft FERC Brief on Settlement Process\\n\\nThe attached is a rough draft of a potential filing Enron would make in to \\nJudge Wagner in the Settlement process (it is unclear if this would remain \\nconfidential per the gag order).\\n\\nPlease provide Ray Alvarez your comments.

But no one knew by h=\\now much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20\\nThe ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=\\n98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =\\npremium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=\\nit risk in selling to the state.=20\\nO'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=\\nime the ISO declares a power alert.=20\\nIn-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO.

It was the first such emergency since =\\nMay 31.\\n     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=\\nnded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=\\nmergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=\\nes to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20\\n     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=\\ne most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=\\n grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.\\n     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =\\nis supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare=\\nntly drove away sellers, Hart said.\\n     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=\\n the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=\\nad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=\\n backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=\\n Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit=\\n of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.\\n     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =\\na Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=\\nssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=\\nen it should take effect. They got no answer.\\n     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=\\nify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=\\nuppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.\\n     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=\\nt is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=\\nce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=\\ntely.\\n     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =\\nhad anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in =\\npart because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr=\\need to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea=\\nch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this =\\nsummer.\\n     \\\"Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through,\\\" Hart said=\\n.=20\\n\\nCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJames D Steffes\\n07/06/2001 10:04 PM\\nTo:=09Jeffrey T Hodge/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert C Williams/Enron@EnronXGate\\ncc:=09Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda R=\\nobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Alan Comnes/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enr=\\non@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Ray Alvarez/N=\\nA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com=20\\n\\nSubject:=09ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGDE - Draft FERC Brief on Settlement Proc=\\ness\\n\\nThe attached is a rough draft of a potential filing Enron would make in to =\\nJudge Wagner in the Settlement process (it is unclear if this would remain =\\nconfidential per the gag order).\\n\\nPlease provide Ray Alvarez your comments.

He is expected to announce how bidding into the\\nforward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs.\\n\\n     The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar\\nfiling with federal regulators in the near future, sources said.\\n\\n     In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a\\nmeasure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a\\nmajority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of\\nmarket power, the ISO has said in prior meetings.\\n\\n     Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators\\ncan influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power\\noccurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of\\ngeneration ownership \\\"allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high\\ndemand periods.\\\"\\n\\n     About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in\\nthe spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO.\\n\\n     In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to\\nenter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the\\ndaily market price fluctuations.\\n\\n     Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a \\\"key\\nsource of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000,\\\" according to an ISO\\nreport.\\n\\n     The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid\\noperator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required\\nto approve such an action.\\n\\n     EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action\\n\\n\\n\\n     The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to\\nGary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board.\\nHeath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news\\nconference.\\n\\n     \\\"We're trying to find out what's behind this,\\\" Heath told Dow Jones\\nNewswires. \\\"We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It\\ncame as a surprise.\\\"\\n\\n     Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to\\neclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by\\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month.\\n\\n     FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market\\nthis past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably\\ncompetitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have\\nblamed the ISO for this summer's power woes.\\n\\n     -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\\nmailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com\\n\\n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 20-10-00\\n\\n     0307GMT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael E.

Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) subsidiary Nevada Power experienced blackouts due to the new price controls. The price caps have resulted in a lack of speed and clarity in the market, discouraging utilities from selling excess power and hindering the effectiveness of voluntary curtailment programs. Additionally, long-term supply contracts signed before the price cap order penalize companies like SRP. The situation in Nevada highlights the unintended effects of price caps outside of California.\",\n          \"Enron has drafted a potential filing for Judge Wagner in the Settlement process, but it is unclear if it will remain confidential. The draft discusses the unintended consequences of federal price limits on power companies, which have led to increased threats of blackouts in California and Nevada. The states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to revise the price mitigation plan to deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. There is confusion and uncertainty among suppliers about the new price restrictions, causing some to withhold power from California. Enron is seeking comments on the draft before filing it.\",\n          \"The email thread discusses the California electricity crisis and the state's power purchases. The Davis administration reveals that over $5 billion has been spent on power purchases, with a significant portion going to government-owned utilities and companies accused of price gouging. The documents also show that almost 40% of the state's purchases come from government-run power generators in California and the Northwest. There is debate over whether the price drop is due to long-term contracts or if the Davis administration rushed into deals committing the state to high prices. State Senator Byron Sher presents a compromise proposal to rescue financially ailing Edison, which involves power producers taking a 30% \\\"haircut\\\" and forgiving some of Edison's debts, while big users would pay off the remaining debts.

These agencies offered power at high prices during times of high demand, inflating costs across the spot market. The study by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) also identified private companies, like Powerex and Mirant, for alleged excessive profits.

Spokesmen deny any market manipulation. \\n\\nBy ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers\\n\\n????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water \\nand Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels \\nthat helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and \\nfall, according to public and confidential records. \\n?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have \\nchiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into \\ndarkness and economic chaos. \\n?????But they are just part of the equation. \\n?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that \\nhave allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does \\nidentify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for \\nthe first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized \\nprofits in the volatile spot market. \\n?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a \\nrecent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently \\ntrying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville \\nPower Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's \\nBC Hydro in British Columbia. \\n?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers \\noffered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when \\nthe state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three \\nlargest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas \\n& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. \\n?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, \\nanalyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in \\nthe spot, or \\\"real-time,\\\" market from May to November. The study accounted \\nfor factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of \\nscarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. \\n?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. \\n?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits \\nas British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show. \\n?????\\\"They were the most aggressive bidders,\\\" said Anjali Sheffrin, author of \\nthe coded study. \\n?????\\\"They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,\\\" \\nsaid Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. \\n?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive \\nprofits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private \\ngenerators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy \\nMarketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged \\ninflated earnings. \\n?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they \\nplayed by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan \\nand did not exploit the state's troubles. \\n?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of \\nsevere power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise \\novernight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be \\nproduced inexpensively but sold for a premium. \\n?????\\\"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity \\nwould be at any given time,\\\" said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. \\\"We \\nhelped keep the lights on in California.\\\" \\n?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC \\nHydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a \\\"rainy day\\\" account to \\nensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. \\n?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list \\nof alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices \\nduring periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire \\nspot market, where emergency purchases are made. \\n?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power \\nat incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest \\nincreases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them \\nfrom falling. \\n?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity \\nultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston \\nand Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy \\nmarket. \\n?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that \\ncould pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, \\nreferring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. \\\"The data shows they \\nclearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load \\nconditions.\\\" \\n?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings \\n\\\"outrageous,\\\" insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. \\n?????\\\"These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes \\nunpunished in this state,\\\" Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert \\nmore blackouts across the state. \\n?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for \\nsurplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to \\nproduce. \\n?????\\\"We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%,\\\" he said. \\n\\\"It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down \\ntheir throats.\\\" \\n?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never \\ntook it personally. \\\"If you're innocent,\\\" he said, \\\"you don't look at the \\ncriminal file.\\\" \\n?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's \\nderegulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, \\na nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal \\ndams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. \\n?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but \\nreaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it \\nsupplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was \\nin the top five accused of taking excessive profits. \\n?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back \\nfederal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon \\nrecovery program. \\n?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act \\nimproperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached \\nits conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading \\nfor last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. \\n?????\\\"From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we \\noperated precisely within the terms of their rules,\\\" Oliver said. \\n?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so \\ndistorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act \\nresponsibly, has bailed out. \\n?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier \\nstudied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, \\nthe highest. \\n?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers \\noffering power received the highest price paid in any hour. \\n?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to \\nsell at a single-digit price. \\n?????\\\"They weren't the culprits,\\\" said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. \\\"Someone else \\ndrove that up.\\\" \\n?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California \\nmarket because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he \\nsaid, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. \\n?????\\\"We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw,\\\" \\nhe said. \\n?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the \\nprice for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because \\nthe overall prices are still excessive. \\n?????\\\"We're saying the patient is sick,\\\" Sheffrin said of California's \\nelectricity market. \\\"It needs help [and] may die.\\\" \\n????? ---------------------- Forwarded by Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT on 05/01/2001 12:46 \\nPM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nAlan Comnes\\n04/11/2001 02:02 PM\\nTo: seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, \\nasettanni@bracepatt.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tim \\nHeizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: LADWP, BC Hydro, Bonneville Accused of Gouging California\\n\\nThe identities refered to in this article apparently relate to Sheffrin's \\nstudy.\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT on 04/11/2001 02:08 \\nPM ---------------------------\\nFrom: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON on 04/11/2001 11:49 AM CDT\\nSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\\nTo: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly \\nAden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol \\nMoffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT, \\nChristina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Craig H Sutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan \\nLeff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, \\nDon Black/HOU/EES@EES, Douglas Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward \\nSacks/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES, \\nEvan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Gayle W \\nMuench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, \\nHarold G Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, Iris \\nWaser/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, \\nJeff Messina/HOU/EES@EES, Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess \\nHewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen \\nDenne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathy Bass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken \\nGustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevin Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, \\nLeticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES, Mark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha \\nSuggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES, Meredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, \\nMichael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Mann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D \\nCisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, mpalmer@enron.com, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil \\nHong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard \\nL Zdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard \\nShapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rosalinda \\nTijerina/HOU/EES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah \\nNovosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, \\nSharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES, skean@enron.com, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tasha \\nLair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tim \\nBelden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES, \\nVladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S \\nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kathryn Corbally/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jubran \\nWhalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Robert C \\nWilliams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James \\nWright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Dirk vanUlden/Western \\nRegion/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Steve Walker/SFO/EES@EES, Jennifer \\nRudolph/HOU/EES@EES, wgang@enron.com, Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com>, \\nHedy Govenar <hgovenar@govadv.com> @ ENRON, jklauber@llgm.com, Mike D \\nSmith/HOU/EES@EES, Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Eric Letke/DUB/EES@EES, \\nRichard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com, Michael \\nTribolet/ENRON@enronXgate, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J \\nMara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mercy Gil/Enron@EnronXGate, Jennifer \\nThome/NA/Enron@Enron, David Leboe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda \\nRobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron, Donna \\nFulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: LADWP, BC Hydro, Bonneville Accused of Gouging California\\n\\nEnergy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too \\n Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices \\nup.
